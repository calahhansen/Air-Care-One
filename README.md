# Bio for game (Brainstorming)
 Dragon warrior-esque, FF
  FF10 type of set up
    Have a explore mode(first page)
    Have a battle mode(2nd page)
  RPG type of set up
    One page that encompasses the explore and the battle mode
    The page would be able to scroll sideways continuously
Need API for Presidents/politicians, their special moves can be a specific fact
Need an Avatar API
  D&D
  Marvel
Giphy API for animations of attacking
  These Giphys would show things related to the type of character you are
    So skeleton avatar will call for skeleton giphys attacking things
API for Soundbits from politicians and presidents


# What we are going to do:

Generate little avatars that fight politicians and such
RPG kind of game
Probably will need an API for potential politicians
API for avatar
Levels to go through
Fighting through presidents and stuff
Add fire Emblem mechanics
  Chessboard movement
  Chessboard Attack range
Using images for backgrounds to fight them,
  Or using the images to show as the avatars
