## How to contribute alongside of the EEVEE Ensemble Team:

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/iamtor9/got-milk/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/iamtor9/got-milk/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/rails/iamtor9/got-milk/issues/new) on GitHub. We :heart: new ideas for future features!

* Be sure to include a **title** such as AMAZING IDEA and a **clear description**, with as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating that you can blow our minds!

#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**

This group project is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join Team EEVEE Ensemble!

Thanks!
