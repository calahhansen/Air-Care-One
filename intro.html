        <h1>Those who shall not care, will end in defeat with the Care Bear stare</h1>

      <p>Once upon a time in a land far away, thousands of years ago, millions of Care Bears thrived across the land we know as Care de Casa…. 
        
        Care Bears lived here with rainbows, positivity, and chocolate trees… 
        
        <p>Then one day out of the sky the suited man landed on the land of positivity and made the thirteen colonies. What was once a land full of sunshine and rainbows, became thirteen sectors of concrete, raining taxi cabs, and suited man… a.k.a. presidents… with mystical powers. 

        What has happened to the Care Bear population, is unfathomable… </p>
        
       <p>A moment of silence....</p> 
        
        
       <p>Today, there only remains five of the Care Bears who have been in hiding, unknown as to where the rest of their Care Bear Crew has vanished to… while the thirteen colonies have prospered in unity of a grand patriotic ceremony. </p>
        
         <p> The Presidents no nothing of what is about to come. 
           The fiery and passion of the Care in the Bears is back. The Care Bears are ready to use their powers and stares that scare… to take back the land that was once lollipops and chocolate trees… and maybe just maybe… find the rest of the Care Bears and declare their independence to have the land of Care de Casa free of the suited man again….</p>
